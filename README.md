## What is DevHub:

I'm not the author of DevHub (its creators are [driaug](https://github.com/driaug) and [boon-cpu](https://github.com/boon-cpu)). Let me tell you a story: I was scrolling on Reddit, and saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/lxtine/devhub_the_backend_only_social_media/), the concept is a "backend only" social media, designed for the programmers.
So I wanted to make a client for the app, and for this project, it will rest in the command line interface!

## How to use it:

- You just have to clone it and make sure to have [node](https://nodejs.org) installed and also [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) (the node package manager)
- then start the command `npm install` to install the dependencies
- then you can start `npm start` to start the project from you command line interface.

And you will see the code run in your command line interface, now you are ready to go!
